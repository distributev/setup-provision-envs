0. Troubleshooting - Hyper-V should be Off in Windows Features (otherwise Vagrant will not work)

1. Original Inspiration was from - https://github.com/distributev/wordpress-laravel-docker-local-cloud/blob/master/provisioning/local-vagrant/Vagrantfile

2. The solution seems to be incomplete (and useless) since 15-vagrant-up/Vagrantfile only starts Ubuntu and provisions / installs Dokku but it does nothing to integrate with my application code.
